Simulate an OFDM wireless system in PYTHON with 𝑁 = 64 subcarriers for a channel 
with 𝐿 = 3 i.i.d. Rayeleigh fading unit gain channel taps. Generate the BER curves vs 
dB SNR for QPSK symbols loaded over all the subcarriers and also superimpose the 
plots obtained via the corresponding analytical expression derived in class lectures. 
Choose the SNR range so as to obtain BER values up to 10^−4
